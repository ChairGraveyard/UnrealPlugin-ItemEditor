# UE4 Plugin Item Editor (WIP)
This UE4 plugin currently creates a new Asset "Item Database" that stores game
items. It provides a new editor window for the asset, supporting item
categories, inline property editing, and undo/redo.

## Installation
Clone the repository and open .uproject file with UE4 editor. The project is
only built and tested on Linux. Bug reports are welcome.
